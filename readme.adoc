== LabelSelection

This is a plugin for https://www.sketchapp.com/[Sketch]. It adds a semi-transparent box with a label on top of the current selection. The label is using the name of the first element of the selection.

This allows for adding explanations to UI designs, e.g. so that implementors know which groups or components are to be used to create a certain page or dialog.
